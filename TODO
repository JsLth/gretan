- Add functionality to search bar -> search through tab names
- Fix inputPicker overlapping with Leaflet UI
- Create separate R files for each category (cs.R, indan.R, explorer.R, intro.R)
  to store function files and texts
- Add texts to global `txts` object
- reduce dependencies
- implement SQL workflows and remove data from memory


Think about using these functions/packages:
- shinyWidgets::execute_safely() (show popups instead of failing on error)
- package:gargoyle (more careful observing)
- package:R6 (standardized workflow pipelines)
