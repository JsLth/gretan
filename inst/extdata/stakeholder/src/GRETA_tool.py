'''
This module contains the elements to build a tool for pLAtYpus, which was
first done with GRETA.
This tool would contain a number of sliders with which the user
can modify certain values:
-initial yes values (per country, product, and stakeholder),
- weights (that are pan-european, so only per product and stakeholder),
- survey category results (per country, product, and stakeholder)

The update_from_slider function updates the pLAtYpus.sqlite3 database
with the change value of a given slider. It has two arguments:
1) slider_name: The name of the slider/quantity, which
    has the following structure (so name/ID your sliders in the same way):
    type__product__stakeholder__country__survey_topic__adopt_leave
    where:
    a) type is either initial_yes, survey_topic, or intention_weight
    b) product is either autonomous_cars, or sustainable_transport,
    or cooperative_self_generation
    c) stakeholder is either citizens, business, or government
    d) country is either the country's name, or EU for weights (note that
    you can actually put anything you want (if it's a valid string), as
    weights are pan-europeanin this version of the model)
    e) survey_topic is one of the survey topics, so it does not need to be
    given for initial_yes (for this one, you can stop after giving the country)
     For survey_topic, it can be : agency_to_engage,
    emotions, environmental_outcomes, outcomes_to_the_individual_and_household,
    relation_score_citizens, relation_score_government, relation_score_business
    (not that only two of the latter three exist, as the relation score only
    pertains to the other stakeholders). Note that social norm
    is not present, as it comes from the engagement levels).
    For intention_weight, it can be: outcomes_to_the_individual_and_household,
    agency_to_engage, environmental_outcomes, social_norm, engagement_emotion,
    or dominant_relational_model
    f) adopt_leave is either Adopt or Leave (and only needed for survey_topic)

    Note that the elements need to be separated with a dunder/double underscore
2) slider_value: The new value of the quantity/slider
The function then calls the relevant updating function
(update_survey_topic_values, update_initial_yes, update_intention_weights)


The reset_to_survey function resets the values to the ones from the survey
(that is before the sliders are used). It uses the parameters as arguments.
You can get them with the following two lines of code:
    parameters_file_name = 'pLAtYpus.toml'
    parameters = cook.parameters_from_TOML(parameters_file_name)


The get_output_tables produces Dataframes that can be used to produce plots
for a given product. It takes the product name (autonomous_cars,
sustainable_transport, cooperative_self_generation) and the parameters as
arguments. You can get them with the following two lines of code:
    parameters_file_name = 'pLAtYpus.toml'
    parameters = cook.parameters_from_TOML(parameters_file_name)
The output of the function is data_from_maps, adoption_curves
data_from_maps is a DataFrame that contains the long-term averages
for engagement levels of stakeholders in each country for the topic at hand
adoption_curves is a dictionary of country DataFrames. You can get
the DataFrame of a given country by calling it (adoption_curves[country]).
You then get a DataFrame for the time-evolution if the engagement curves
of all three stakeholders in that country for teh product at hand.


The make_outputs function makes the plots/figures for a given product
and country (you can also use EU if you want to change them all,
which you should do if you change the weights,
as they apply to all countries).
