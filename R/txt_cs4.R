        However, the exploitation of the Groningen gas fields brought about
        substantial environmental and societal challenges, including land
        subsidence and destructive earthquakes. Responding to a particularly
        severe earthquake in 2018, the Dutch government made a groundbreaking
        decision to close the Groningen gas fields and launch an ambitious
        initiative to shift away from natural gas. This initiative, known as
        the Programma Aardgasvrije Wijken (PAW), set out to achieve a minimum
        of 49% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.")),
