      interactions among actors affect the emergence of energy citizenship
      and the level of engagement to energy citizenship in the case of
      UR BEROA.<br><br>
      UR BEROA is an energy cooperative providing energy to its 550
      members living at Bera Bera neighbourhood in Donostia-San Sebastian,
      Spain. The cooperative was established in 1985 for the purpose of
      providing district heating and hot water for the residents of the
      neighbourhood.<br><br>
      Over the years, UR BEROA has successfully implemented solutions to
      produce cleaner energy and currently, the facilities consist of
      three natural gas boilers, a cogeneration engine, a biomass boiler,
      and solar panels. UR BEROA is currently taking another step towards
      decarbonisation with the installation of photovoltaic (PV) system
      providing electricity to around 100 households.<br><br>
      Overall, the goal of the cooperative is to drive a shift towards
      higher level of decarbonisation and energy efficiency. The
      cooperative aims to significantly grow its member base, increase
      the energy services it provides, and implement collective renewable
      energy-based self-consumption."
