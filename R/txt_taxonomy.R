  "The taxonomy of geographical levels and drivers for energy citizenship
  emergence provides a framework for the definition of the emerging characters
  of energy citizenship at different geographical levels: local, regional,
  national, supranational and the transversal virtual level. The context of the
  emergence of energy citizenship entails several proximity domains and
  dimensions. The taxonomy shows that different geographical levels play
  important roles in triggering the birth of different forms of energy
  citizenship but mostly in supporting citizens\u2019 engagement to grow and
  proceed in this pathway. It represents a multi-layered structure of relations
  and interdependencies that need to be considered while approaching the topic.
  This suggests looking at energy citizenship from a local-global networking
  perspective. This is useful to connect leveraging mechanisms, to provide
  solutions to barriers and bottlenecks and, finally, to contribute to better
  policy recommendations. More information on the taxonomy can be found in
  Deliverable 5.1."

  "The definition of the GRETA taxonomy followed a mixed methodological
  approach. At first a theoretical background on geographical levels, scale
  and dimensions where energy citizenship emerges. This analysis has been based
  on literature on energy citizenship and behaviours, and on policy documents
  at the EU and global levels. Energy citizenship is framed as differentiating
  phenomena occurring in different geographical domains. Drawing from the
  literature on energy communities and behaviours, the review aimed at
  highlighting deductions about geographical levels. The policy analysis at
  the EU level comprehended a review of the most significant documents
  collecting empirical evidence on energy citizenship, case studies of
  energy communities or collective energy initiatives from EU projects, which
  can provide insights to understand the individual and collective level of
  energy citizenship (Annex A). Sources are the EU COM JRC publication \u201cEnergy
  communities: an overview of energy and social innovation\u201d and the JPI Urban
  Europe \u2018Positive Energy Districts Case Studies Booklet\u2019. Detecting
  determinants and conditions for EC at each geographical level, the taxonomy
  explores the EU-wide context of geographical levels of the emergence of
  energy citizenship. Secondly a case study analysis has been performed,
  highlighting the geographical levels in which energy citizenship, as defined
  by the WP1 framework, emerges and is recognized. A selection was made both
  on the GRETA case studies, based on the relevance of the case study and the
  amount of information acquired by the partners at the time the deliverable
  was written and on European cases of energy communities."
