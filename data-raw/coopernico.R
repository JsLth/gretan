# Let's load the data first
coopernico <- readxl::read_xlsx("coopernico_data/coopernico-sample.xlsx", 1)

# The file contains 57 observations for two funding projects of Coopernico: Lar S. Silvestre and
# Escola JG Zarco. The data reports the gender of the sponsors, the ZIP code of residence and the
# amount of financial investment. The ZIP variable reports four-digit ZIP codes not the more detailed
# seven-digit ZIP codes. Portuguese ZIP codes are a combination of four and three digits. The first four
# report a correspondence area which normally is equivalent to the "old" districts (Freguesias before 2014).
# Four digit ZIP codes which end on 1,6 or 9 are normally associated with commercial or public addresses and
# not necessarily represented areas (I do not find any of these in the data). The additional three digits
# would have reported more detailed street segments but they are not included in the data. The data also reports one entry from Switzerland, which can be
# removed for now.
coopernico <- subset(coopernico, ZIP != "Switzerland")

# Public sources do not offer ZIP-code-based shapefiles for Portugal. There is one Github-repository, though,
# which transformed ZIP code data into a shapefile. We will use this data.

    keep = 0.1, # Keep 10% of original edges
    method = NULL, # Modified Visvalingam algorithm
    keep_shapes = FALSE # don't remove small shapes
  )

# We are interested in the geographical distribution of the Coopernico sponsors. Let's
# collapse the Coopernico data into ZIP-code-level data and merge with the shapefile.
