# GRETA Analytics

## Getting started



### Installation

It is planned to deploy the app as a standalone executable using [RInno](https://github.com/ficonsulting/RInno). Until then, the dashboard has to be built from source or accessed using a prototyping server.

### Building from source

The app is built under the golem framework and installs like an R package:

```
devtools::install_github("JsLth/greta-gis-tool")
```
